{"_id":"4g5ZJWG18rjdUQ2P","name":"02 - Introduction","content":"<p><strong>Location</strong>: Briefing room aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt.</p>\n<p><strong>Foundry VTT Scene:</strong> Use the Main scene from the Up the Creek Scene compendium for this section.</p>\n<p>Read aloud or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Three months ago the world as we knew it changed. Strange bridges descended from the sky in various places around the planet, and where they landed reality itself bent and changed. Invaders crossed the bridges and now they’re turning Earth into something else, piece by piece. The clash of realities creates storms, and a few special people are changed by the storm. They become heroes, the best version of themselves from this or an alternate reality. You and those seated in this room are some of those people.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The base Foundry system for Torg Eternity includes 16 archetype characters as a part of its built-in compendium. Have each player select from among the following archetypes by dragging the archetype from the compendium into the Actor tab: Electric Samurai, Reality Raider, Prmitive Warrior, Masked Crusader and/or Monster Hunter. Other archetypes can be used, but detailed instructions on how to handle them are not incluced in this adventure. The background tab of each character sheet explains who the character is, and what they do. Have each player select a name for their character, and let them describe who is seated in the briefing room and greet one another. Delay any questions about what statistics mean or what the Tactics section refers to for now.</p>\n<p>On each sheet call everyone’s attention to the Moment of Crisis. This is the exact instant the hero changed from an ordinary person into a Storm Knight. This happens when a person is faced with danger and makes an active choice to help others or fight to repulse an invading reality. When this happens raw energy floods into the hero, and they gain the power to bend reality to their own will. In game terms that means they each get Possibility tokens and a hand of Destiny cards.</p>\n<h3>Possibility Energy</h3>\n<p>Each player should set their availiable possiblities to three (3). They can spend these to avoid damage or boost their dice rolls. Don’t explain the specifics of either of those uses yet, but this indicates the amount of power they have to “push back” against reality. When a player does something that delights everyone at the table, give them another Possibility point as a reward. Note: The Realm Runner starts with four possibilities instead of three.</p>\n<h3>Destiny Cards</h3>\n<p>Each player should draw four (4) Destiny cards. For detailed instructions on how this is done, see @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.9l3qvlJ9eFizcEor]{Managing Cards}.</p>\n<p>Each card explains what it does, but may not make sense until the first tests below. Outside of combat these cards may be played or traded between players (one for one) at any time.</p>\n<h2>THE MISSION BRIEFING</h2>\n<p>An officer (Captain McDonnell if asked) briefs the Storm Knights on the mission. Read the following aloud.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The Delphi Council has asked us to support a reconnaissance mission into the alien zone that’s taken over both coastlines of North America. The ‘Living Land’ they’re calling it. If we send regular troops into the zone their weapons malfunction and some even revert to a primitive mental state. But you Storm Knights aren’t as severely affected by altered reality, so we’re depending on you. These invading zones are bordered by stone monoliths called stelae. We’re studying these stelae to figure out how we can use them against the invaders—but first we have to locate them!</p>\n<p>“Your mission is simple, but not necessarily easy. We have a converted tour boat for you to take inland. Get as far as you can up the Columbia river, past the ruins of Astoria. There are survivors living there who got word of a stela somewhere inland, maybe a backup of some kind. When you reach the wreckage of the Route 433 bridge go ashore, find that stela, and determine if it’s just stone or something else. Don’t try to destroy it at this time, we just want its coordinates and a “feeling” from Storm Knights on whether it’s dangerous or not.</p>\n<p>“Any questions?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Potential Questions and Answers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What can we expect in the Living Land?</strong> Conditions and brutal and primitive. Technology much beyond spears and bows doesn’t work for ordinary people—at least not for long—and metal rusts at an accelerated rate if left unattended. Most affected humans become ruled by instinct and savage impulses. The invaders there are lizardmen known as edeinos. Oh, and watch out for the dinosaurs.</li>\n<li><strong>What about the survivors in Astoria? </strong>They have a walled community built around a house made famous by some movie. Some landmarks resist the change in reality, and around them are pockets of unaltered “Core Earth” where people can stay. Astoria has one of these.</li>\n<li><strong>Is the boat armed?</strong> No, but you Storm Knights are. This is a reconnaissance mission, not an assault, and this is just a converted tourist boat meant for transportation and little else.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once any questions are answered, proceed to @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.LqYEn2OP1Oxe9XNi]{03 - Scene One: The Journey Begins}.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A9LyAqagoJJU3gDH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.z4J9hKbVShYvJ8IY"}}}

Here’s what each condition means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Setback</strong>: If the heroes suffer a Setback vines (or Gospog) get caught in the propeller and the boat slows down…allowing another 2 Gospog to clamber aboard each Villain turn until the jam is cleared. To clear it a character must move to the back of the boat and make a DN 10 Strength test. If the villains suffer a Setback remove one Gospog as the vines growing on it get caught in the propeller and it is pulled in and ground into small chunks!</li>\n<li><strong>Confused</strong>: The Heroes may not activate Destiny Cards. They may still earn them and play them into their Action Pools (see @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.LqYEn2OP1Oxe9XNi]{03 - Scene One: The Journey Begins}).</li>\n<li><strong>Up</strong>: The side with an Up rolls a die for tests, and then immediately adds another die regardless of the result!</li>\n<li><strong>Fatigue</strong>: Each hero immediately suffers 2 Shock (see Shock below). If the hero is wearing Armor with the Fatigues property she suffers 3 Shock instead, or more if the Armor lists a larger number! Gospog are immune to Shock, so a Fatigued result doesn’t hamper them at all!</li>\n<li><strong>Inspiration</strong>: Each character on the affected side recovers 2 Shock. See @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.JN6ZbILajAthoEBS]{Damage}.</li>\n<li><strong>Surge</strong>: The reality of the Living Land pushes against Storm Knights who have contradictory items. Each player rolls a d20. On a 1, a character with a contradiction Disconnects (see below). The Realm Runner is carrying items that don’t just exceed the Living Land’s axioms, they exceed his own! He Disconnects on a roll of 1-4 so long as he’s carrying them.</li>\n<li><strong>Flurry</strong>: Resolve all actions for that side normally. Then every character on that side acts again!</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Approved Actions</h3>\n<p>At the bottom of the card one or two of the following are listed: Attack, Defend, Intimidate, Maneuver, Taunt, and Trick, plus “Any” and “Any Multi-Action”. If a character attempts the listed action and succeeds the player draws a new Destiny Card. Introduce the basics of Actions below, and then add the explanations for Defend, Interactions (Intimidate, Maneuver, Taunt, Trick), Multi-Actions, and the Law of Savagery only when the relevant Approved Action comes up for the turn.</p>\n<h3>The Law of Savagery and All-Out Attacks</h3>\n<p>If Attack is an Approved Action, describe the All-Out Attack special option to players. This option is only available to hand to hand attacks, so melee weapons or unarmed combat. The attacker gains a +4 bonus to hit, but becomes Very Vulnerable (+4) in return. The option is always available, but the Law of Savagery makes it especially tempting when Attack is Approved: a hit with an All-Out Attack gains an extra Bonus Die (+1 BD) of damage…in addition to any other dice granted by a Good or Outstanding success. Note that Villains, even Gospog, take advantage of this option when Attack is Approved!</p>\n<h3>Steps and Dilemmas</h3>\n<p>Along the side are letters (A, B, C, and D) or a Dilemma (Complication, Critical Problem, and Potential Setback).

As you cross over into the Living Land you get goosebumps and feel the crackling energy or reality that only Storm Knights are attuned to.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Axioms &amp; World Laws</h2>\n<p>Reveal @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.XEYr34ZyAggBFLI8]{The Living Land Table Tent} journal entry to the players. Then, point out the features of The Living Land set out in @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.MXSfDu4jcJQFdRcT]{Axioms and World Laws}. </p>\n<h3>Cosm Cards</h3>\n<p>Deal each player one Living Land Cosm Card. These cards may be played at ANY time, and often grant the player or all the heroes more Possibilities. Some ideas for dealing with specific Cosm cards in this adventure may be found in @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.z8l7gqSGveLarn4X]{Cosm Cards}.</p>\n<h2>The Adventure Continues...</h2>\n<p>Reveal the map of the boat to the players and ask them to decide who’s piloting the boat. Let each player position their character around the ship and describe what they’re doing. To place themselves on the boat, have the players drag their character from the Actor tab onto the map. This will create a token for their character.</p>\n<p>None of the characters have a water vehicles skill so it doesn’t really matter who steers, but only a modern character like the Realm Runner understands how it operates and can operate it without additional contradiction. One or more characters is probably keeping a lookout. Good! They all get to roll a test for that shortly.</p>\n<p>Read aloud or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Your boat motors past the crumbling ruins of Astoria. A few vine–covered skyscrapers remain standing in the distance. Pterodactyls swoop around them and nest in the upper floors. The rest of the city is nothing but ruins covered by a thick canopy of jungle. It’s as if the city were bombed a hundred years ago and nature has reclaimed the remains—except it happen practically overnight. It’s hot and humid in the Living Land, even though the air at sea was cold and brisk.</p>\n<p>“The jungle trees are massive, and branches stretch all the way across the wide Columbia river to form a dense canopy overhead. Vines dangle down into the river and an occasional low–hanging branch scrapes alone the side of the vessel as it moves upriver.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>FIRST TESTS</h2>\n<p>Show the players the rules for @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.BObjqEscCh7lrbni]{Skill and Attribute Tests}. Then, have each character make a find test to see if they spot trouble while moving up the river. Have each character complete the test one at a time.  This is a fundamental game mechanic and comes up often, so take the time to get everyone used to it now!</p>\n<p>Using the Skill and Attributes Tests journal entry and the chat output generated by each character as a guide, explain the following concepts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How the Action Total is compared to a Difficulty Number (in this case, the DN is 10) to determine an outcome.</li>\n<li>The types of results (Mishaps, Failures, Successes, Good Successes, and Outstanding Successes)</li>\n<li>How the Action Total is determined (Base Skill plus Bonus Number from dice)</li>\n<li>How possibilities and cards can be used to improve results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After everyone has made a roll, apply the results as follows:</p>\n<h3>Failure</h3>\n<p>If a character fails this test they are Stymied, a condition that gives them a –2 on all tests until the end of their next Action.</p>\n<h3>Success (10 or Better)</h3>\n<p>Anyone that generates a total of 10 or more on their find test sees a logjam of flotsam, decomposing jungle foliage, and scattered human bodies washing downriver. The boat easily maneuvers to avoid the larger logs, but the corpses begin to scream and clamber up onto the ship’s deck! Combat begins as below, but at least the character is ready.</p>\n<h3>Good (15 or Better)</h3>\n<p>Just like a success, but the character saw the twitching limbs of the corpses and realized early that these weren’t dead bodies, they were Gospog! Gospog are horrifying creatures made by the invaders by planting strange seeds in the bodies of those killed during the invasion. When the Gospog begin to scream any character with a Good success or better gets a +2 bonus on the Fear test (see below).</p>\n<h3>Outstanding (20 or Better)</h3>\n<p>Like a Good success, but the character was on guard enough to warn the boat to maneuver enough away from the bodies that the gospog take extra time getting aboard. When the Encounter starts (see below) if the Villains would have acted first they merely arrive around the ship rather than gaining actions. If a character has an Alertness Destiny Card and wants to spend it, treat it as if someone got an Outstanding result!</p>\n<h2>FIRST ENCOUNTER</h2>\n<p>Gospog lurch into the boat, trying to bite and rend the flesh of the living! There are two Gospog of the First Planting for each hero present. The first thing to do is to draw a Drama card and place it on the desktop to set the initiative and any special conditions for the turn.</p>\n<p>There are two Gospog of the First Planting for each Storm Knight.

You only roll one attack, but add a +1 bonus to their Action Total.</p>\n<h3 style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-weight:bold;font-family:Alaska\">The Players' Turn</h3>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-family:Palatino;font-size:12px\">When it is time for the players to act, ask them who wants to go first. Then, explain the basics of a player turn, using the Combat journal entry as a guide:</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-family:Palatino;font-size:12px\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">During their turn, a character can (a) @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.prbDBaVAlMkytvbo]{Move} up to their walking speed with no penalty, or up to their run speed with a -2 penalty to all checks on this turn and (b) take an action.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">For their action, a character can make a normal @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.5ax6sbR4BFCqp7IN]{Attack}</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">A character can make an @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.UdOHo3I4piwEd6vO]{Interaction Attack} for their action</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">A character can also @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.sHmYbJh6Wu7E9ayo]{Defend} as their action.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;font-family:Palatino;font-size:12px\"><strong style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text\">Action Pools.</strong> At the end of the first player's round, explain the concept of the Action Pool from the @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.YkPR3np1UePORPcV]{Combat} journal entry.</p>\n<h2>THE END OF THE BATTLE</h2>\n<p>When the last Gospog is defeated everyone unmarks any cards left in their Action Pools. If a player has more than four cards, discard down to four. This marks the end of the scene, so any player with fewer than four cards draws back up to four.

To begin, place all of the characters in Step A.</p>\n<p>The boat reaches the wreckage of the bridge, and now the Storm Knights must disembark and make their way through the steamy jungles of the Living Land on foot. This is a Dramatic Scene, and the Storm Knights can feel the tension in the air as they begin their search for the stela.</p>\n<p>Read aloud or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“No enemies greet you at the shore, but tracks of the large, three toed feet of edeinos abound, and the distant roar of a massive dinosaur hints of dangers lurking among the massive jungle trees. The situation is tricky. There are hundreds of edeinos in the area. The Storm Knights must follow the trails in the area and find the stela before the majority of the creatures find them!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For this Torg Eternity scene, use the Main Foundry scene that is included with this module.</p>\n<h2>FIRST DRAMATIC SKILL RESOLUTION</h2>\n<p>This scene involves a @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.S5wSL3nDkI2GGoun]{Dramatic Skill Resolution} .</p>\n<p>Using the Dramatic Skill Resolution journal entry as a guide, review the following concepts with the players:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The players have five rounds to complete the objective</li>\n<li>The objective consists of four steps</li>\n<li>To attempt a step, it must be available on the curent Drama card</li>\n<li>After five rounds, enough edeinos will flood the area that the Storm Knights must retreat, resulting in failure.</li>\n<li>A character may attempt more than one step if it is available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The challenges for this Dramatic Skill Resolution include the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Step A</strong>: Follow the trails to the correct area. The clearing for Step A includes paths in multiple directions. The players must select the correct trail. This is a <em>tracking </em>test, DN 10. Most of the heroes don’t have tracking, but they could still make the attempt (Unskilled) using <em>Mind </em>with no adds. Once Step A is successfully completed, open the \"door\" between Step A and Step B on the map, and allow the characters to freely move into the area labeled Step B.</li>\n<li><strong>Step B</strong>: Find a way to wade through a shallow bog. This is a DN 10 <em>find</em> test. Once one character finds a safe way through, the others can follow. Once Step B is successfully completed, open the \"door\" to Step C and allow the players to move through.</li>\n<li><strong>Step C</strong>: Cut through the thick underbrush to reach the stela. This is a DN 10 <em>survival </em>test. Survival is based on <em>Mind</em>. Note that the Realm Runner has a Machete which makes <em>survival </em>Favored. On a Favored test, if you don’t like the first die roll, you may roll again—but you must accept the new result, even if it’s worse! Once Step C is successfully completed, open the \"door\" to step D and allow the characters to move into the clearing.</li>\n<li><strong>Step D</strong>: Sense whether the stela is active, or has any special defenses. This is a DN 14 <em>reality </em>test. Every Storm Knight has reality, which is based on <em>Spirit</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each round, ask the Storm Knights who is attempting the step and let anyone else go first to stack up bonuses or get Supporter Destiny Cards into their Action Pools. If the lead fails the skill test can’t be attempted again that round. A different character may take the lead on every round.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the scene, the doors to Steps B, C, and D are all locked. Once a character has successfully completed a step, unlock and open the door to the next step, allowing the players to move into the next area of the map. To unlock a door, right-click on it. To open a door, click on it.</p>\n<p>To make matters even more complicated, this DSR isn’t happening undisturbed. Small bands of edeinos arrive to skirmish with the Storm Knights (see below). Some of the band must fight off the villains while others work on completing the task. </p>\n<h3>Dilemmas</h3>\n<p>Introduce the following conditions when Dilemmas are raised in the Drama cards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Complication</strong>: A strange mist creeps through the valley with the stela, making navigation much harder depending on where the group is approaching from. If the step fails all future tests against the DSR suffer a –1 penalty.</li>\n<li><strong>Potential Setback</strong>: A larger warband arrives in the area and the heroes must flee and find another route. The last step that was completed is lost. So if the group was testing for step C they now must complete step B again instead.</li>\n<li><strong>Critical Problem</strong>: The edeinos swarm the area in numbers, drawn by the noise and activity. The Storm Knights must retreat to the Step A area to try again. Any completed steps are lost.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Last Ditch Effort</h3>\n<p>Remember that, if it’s the fifth round and the steps aren’t present to complete the task, all isn’t lost. The team can try a Last Ditch Effort. See @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.S5wSL3nDkI2GGoun]{Dramatic Skill Resolution} for details.</p>\n<h2>EDEINOS SKIRMISHERS</h2>\n<p>To complicate the Dramatic Skill Resolution above, edeinos skirmishers harass the heroes at every step of the way, hoping to delay them until the main warband arrives. At the start of the first round place one Edeinos Warrior for each Storm Knight on the map. The edeinos emerge from the thick jungle about 10 meters away from the Storm Knights. On their first turn they move halfway towards the heroes and throw spears (missile weapons), and then move into melee combat range on subsequent turns. If Attack is an Approved Action they run to get into melee range so they can All-Out Attack!</p>\n<p>Each round, at the beginning, another two Edeinos Warriors appear to join the battle. If the heroes suffer a Setback four warriors appear instead! If the villains suffer a setback they receive no reinforcements. If the villains act first, one of the warriors may attempt an Interaction Attack against the lead Storm Knight to Stymie (–2) attempts to gain steps!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-actors.IE5R3CvPVcYV2Plv]{Edeinos Warrior} (1 per Storm Knight)</li>\n<li>@Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-actors.IE5R3CvPVcYV2Plv]{Edeinos Warrior} (2 at the beginning of each subsequent round)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the Edeinos Warriors appear, show the players the @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.DPvuF0KOmThb6aao]{Edeinos Threat Stand}.</p>\n<h3>Mobs</h3>\n<p>Unlike the Gospog, edeinos suffer Shock. With lots of villains on the table it’s recommended that the GM takes any Shock damage in one pile, and every time 10 Shock accumulates remove the most appropriate warrior, usually the one who was last attacked. A blow that Defeats an edeinos with a Wound doesn’t affect this pile one way or another</p>\n<h2>IF THE DRAMATIC SKILL RESOLUTION FAILS</h2>\n<p>Read aloud or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“More and more scaly lizardmen burst through the trees each second, and it’s clear the only chance for survival is to run back to the boat as quickly as possible and flee the area. There are cries and thrown spears clatter off the sides of the vessel as it speeds downriver back towards the coast, but everyone makes it aboard and back to the carrier. You’re disappointed that you didn’t get close enough to learn about the stela, but there will be other missions, other chances to show the invaders that they aren’t invincible.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>IF THE DRAMATIC SKILL RESOLUTION SUCCEEDS</h2>\n<p>Read aloud or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“As you get near the stone monolith you can feel a low, pulsing energy within it, similar to what you feel crossing into the Living Land. As you reach out towards it words and images start flooding into your mind. Backup. This would mark a boundary for the Living Land if one of the main stelae were uprooted. They CAN be uprooted. Devastation. The transformation back to Core Earth reality is violent and obliterates the ordinary people inside the area who have transformed—unless the Storm Knights have flooded the area with Possibility Energy first. The energy that comes from stories, stories of hope and resistance. The same energy that these stelae slowly absorb and send…somewhere. As you concentrate you feel it, this stela is attached to a network that stretches out in every direction. A spider’s web. And at the center of the web a presence of absolute darkness. You hear the name Rec Pakken in whispers, and with a shiver you feel that the darkness is now looking directly at you!</p>\n<p>“You break connection quickly. It’s time to go. Reinforcements are coming, and not just the army of edeinos camped nearby. Everyone rushes back to the boat with edeinos scouts close behind, but you all board and flee downriver before the forces of darkness can strike. You’ve learned something about the invaders, and have the exact location of this backup stela marked. With this information you and the Delphi Council can start the long fight to reclaim the Earth!”</p>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A9LyAqagoJJU3gDH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.LNXI539r3NK8Hmno"}}}

This gives a general feel for gameplay, but there are many more character options and realms to explore in the full game! </p>\n<h2>Setting Up Your Game</h2>\n<p>Before you begin play, you will need to prepare the Destiny Deck and the Living Land Cosm deck:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure that you have installed the basic Drama Deck, the basic Destiny Deck, and the Living Land cosm deck. You probably did this when you installed your world, but if you didn't, you can install them from the System Settings menu.</li>\n<li>After all players are logged in the Foundry game, but before beginning play, be sure that your players have full access to the Destiny deck and the Living Land Cosm deck. To to so, go to the settings tab for the Unofficial Card Support module and click on Deck Settings. From there, make sure all your players are allowed access to draw, view, and discard. Details on how to manage the decks can be found in @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.9l3qvlJ9eFizcEor]{Managing Cards}.</li>\n<li>For this Quickstart, delete the following cards from the Destiny Deck: Martyr, Flurry, Master Plan, Connection, Idea, Attuned, Glory, Romance, Nemesis, Reality Surge, and Maelstrom. The quickest way to do this is to take all of those cards into your own hand and then delete each one.</li>\n<li>After you have taken the above steps, shuffle the Destiny Deck and the Living Land Cosm deck.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To get started with the adventure, proceed to @Compendium[te002-up-the-creek.up-the-creek-journals.4g5ZJWG18rjdUQ2P]{02 - Introduction}.</p>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A9LyAqagoJJU3gDH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.EhUT5u82lsOLxXfj"}}}
{"_id":"z8l7gqSGveLarn4X","name":"Cosm Cards","content":"<p>Each player has a Cosm Card they may play at any time. Cosm Cards don’t need to go into the Action Pool, that’s just for Destiny Cards. Depending upon which cards are played, an adventure can turn out very differently! Here’s a few hints on how to handle the Cosm Cards within this adventure.</p>\n<h3>Dino Attack!</h3>\n<p>The dreaded Tyrannosaur stalks the area. Even if the card is played early, the GM may have it appear at any time during the act, so don’t have it attack the boat. The best time for an appearance is on the second round of the Dramatic Skill Resolution. It focuses on the heroes, but it may gobble up an edeinos or two if they suffer a Setback!</p>\n<h3>Lost Treasure</h3>\n<p>An out of place rubber muck boot lying in the mud draws attention. Upon investigation it turns out the boot is filled with gold dust. A Storm Knight with a successful DN 14 scholar (based on Mind) test might remember doubtful legends of such a boot lost in 1857. The gold has no effect on this adventure, but the Delphi Council or the Storm Knights might get use out of it later!</p>\n<h3>Law of Decay</h3>\n<p>In general award no Possibilities if the item chosen is cosmetic or unlikely to impact the adventure. Award 1 Possibility for backup weapons or ammunition. Award 2 Possibilities for most Armor, the Realm Runner’s special items, or the Machete since it’s survival boost might come in handy during the Dramatic Skill Resolution. A character’s trademark weapon or Armor that provides +4 protection is worth 3 Possibilities!</p>\n<h3>Perils of the Living Land</h3>\n<p>The river is blocked by a new waterfall that the boat can’t navigate. Award each Storm Knight 1 Possibility for the trouble, but they’ve got a longer hike ahead of them to reach the stelae. Have them attempt a DN 14 survival test (one leader, others may do a @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.wa3TfGPytgJyjSFO]{Combined Attack}. If it fails, each Storm Knight suffers a Fatigue result (see @Compendium[torgeternity.basic-rules.KTres6vCn1T1KcKO]{Drama Cards}) on the way to the encounter, and that Shock is still in effect when the encounter starts.</p>\n<h3>The Deep Mist</h3>\n<p>The group only has four rounds to complete the Dramatic Skill Resolution thanks to getting lost. Award each Storm Knight 2 Possibilities for the extra trouble.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"A9LyAqagoJJU3gDH":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.iH7lNn81snQKmk3n"}}}
